- Can set [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) colors
- Can set the current cursor color based on the current airline theme
- Works nicely in the gui or terminal

## Helm Colors

Here is a shot of `helm-mini` with the `airline-base16-shell-dark` and
`airline-papercolor` themes.

## Installation

### Requirements

- `powerline`
- `evil` (optional but recommended)

Install via melpa or clone this repo into your load-path and add the following
to your `init.el`

    (require 'airline-themes)
    (load-theme 'airline-light)

If you don't load a theme in your `init.el` then the default `mode-line-format`
doesn't get set at startup and applying a theme may not look right. If things
don't look right after applying a theme run `airline-themes-set-modeline` or
`(kill-local-variable 'mode-line-format))` and it should apply the styling to
the current buffer.
