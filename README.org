** Features

- Separate colors for each major evil mode (normal, insert, visual, replace, emacs)
- Can set [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] colors
- Can set the current cursor color based on the current airline theme
- Works nicely in the gui or terminal

** Eshell Colors

Here is a shot of eshell in use with the prompt set to match the current airline theme (=airline-base16-shell-dark=):

** Installation

*** Requirements

- =powerline=
- =evil= (optional but recommended)

Install via melpa or clone this repo into your load-path and add the following to your =init.el=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'airline-themes)
  (load-theme 'airline-light t)
#+end_src

If you don't load a theme in your =init.el= then the default =mode-line-format=
doesn't get set at startup and applying a theme may not look right. If things
don't look right after applying a theme run =airline-themes-set-modeline= or
=(kill-local-variable 'mode-line-format))= and it should apply the styling to
the current buffer.

** Custom Options

Run =M-x customize-group airline-themes= to see and set all options with
suggestions. Here are all the options for copy-pasting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Hide Evil and buffer state on inactive buffers.
  ;; Valid Values: t (hidden), nil (shown)
  (setq airline-hide-state-on-inactive-buffers t)

  ;; "Hide eyebrowse indicator on inactive buffers.
  ;; Valid Values: t (hidden), nil (shown)"
  (setq airline-hide-eyebrowse-on-inactive-buffers t)

  ;; Hide vc branch on inactive buffers:
  ;; Valid Values: t (hidden), nil (shown)
  (setq airline-hide-vc-branch-on-inactive-buffers nil)

  ;; Set eshell prompt colors to match the airline theme.
  ;; Valid Values: t (enabled), nil (disabled)
  (setq airline-eshell-colors t)

  ;; Set helm colors to match the airline theme.
  ;; Valid Values: t (enabled), nil (disabled)

  ;; Set the cursor color based on the current evil state.
  ;; Valid Values: t (enabled), nil (disabled)
  (setq airline-cursor-colors t)

  ;; Display the currend directory along with the filename.
  ;; Valid Values: 'airline-directory-full
  ;;               'airline-directory-shortened
  ;;               nil (disabled)
  (setq airline-display-directory nil)

  ;; Max directory length to display when using 'airline-directory-shortened
  (setq airline-shortened-directory-length 30)

  ;; Unicode character choices
  (setq airline-utf-glyph-separator-left #x2b80
        airline-utf-glyph-separator-right #x2b82
        airline-utf-glyph-subseparator-left #x2b81
        airline-utf-glyph-subseparator-right #x2b83
        airline-utf-glyph-branch #x2b60
        airline-utf-glyph-readonly #x2b64
        airline-utf-glyph-linenumber #x2630)

  ;; You may also wish to force powerline to use utf8 character separators
  (setq powerline-default-separator 'utf-8)
  (setq powerline-utf-8-separator-left  #x2b80
        powerline-utf-8-separator-right #x2b82)
#+end_src

- *Glyph Variables*

The =airline-utf-glyph-*= variables control which UTF glyphs are used on the
modeline. They require a powerline patched font. Head over to
https://github.com/powerline/fonts if you need one.

Depending on your font, you may need to set the correct glyph character. If your
font characters don't look right try running =M-x customize-group
airline-themes= and choose some characters that look right with your font. Some
default options have been added so you can pick what looks good.
